Use the Netlify CLI to deploy the project to the production environment.

The Netlify CLI deploy command expects you to specify which directory you wish to deploy. After the Build stage, the website is located in the build directory.

Hint: Don't forget to specify the prod flag to trigger a production deployment.

Add a smoke test after the deployment to check if the environment is available with the following command:

curl https://YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME | grep -q "React App"

1. Ammend the Deploy to prod stage with the following step.

sh 'node_modules/.bin/netlify deploy --dir=build --prod'

2. Execute the pipeline and inspect the logs.
3. Manually verify that the deployment has been successful by opening the website.
4. Add the smoke test to verify the successful deployment:

curl https://YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME | grep -q "React App"
